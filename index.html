                    Four years ago, we created GetGoing with the idea of developing innovative travel products that would open new opportunities for consumers and suppliers. It’s been an amazing journey, as we evolved from an award-winning consumer travel booking website to a platform for improving the business travel booking experience for some of the largest corporations worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are thrilled to continue our journey as part of BCD Travel, where we’ll work on delivering our vision for a modern corporate travel experience on a much larger scale.  BCD Travel is one of the world’s largest travel management companies, operating in 110 countries around the world with 11,000 employees, an industry-leading client retention rate of 96% and sales of US$24.2 billion. We’re looking forward to working as part of BCD Travel to improve the travel searching and booking experience for thousands of BCD travel advisors and millions of business travelers around the world.
